# Are these good user stories to use?
##
## 1. **Title**: Integer greater than 1 returns the integer as a string​
### **Description**: As a student when I enter an integer greater than 1 then it should return the integer as a string so I can give the right answer to the question.​
### **AC 1**: When 1 is given to the program then “1” is returned
### **AC 2**:  When 2 is given to the program then “2” is returned
##
##
## 2. **Title**: Integer evenly divisible by 3 returns "Fizz"
### **Description**: As a student when I enter an integer that is evenly divisible by 3 it should return “Fizz” so that I can give the right answer to the question.​
### **AC 1**: When 3 is given to the program then “Fizz” is returned​
### **AC 2**: When 6 is given to the program then “Fizz” is returned​
##
##
## 3. **Title**: Integer evenly divisible by 5 returns "Buzz"
### **Description**: As a student I want to enter an integer that is evenly divisible by 5 and have it return “Buzz” so that II can give the right answer to the question.
### **AC 1**: When 5 is given to the program then “Buzz” is returned​
### **AC 2**: When 10 is given to the program then “Buzz” is returned​
##
##
## 4. **Title**: Integer evenly divisible by 15 returns "FizzBuzz"
### **Description**: As a student I want to enter an integer that is evenly divisible by 15 and have it return “FizzBuzz” so I can give the right answer to the question.​
### **AC 1**: When 15 is given to the program then “FizzBuzz” is returned
### **AC 2**: When 30 is given to the program then “FizzBuzz” is returned

# Write some tests using Gherkin for FizzBuzz stories.
## Using the new stories from the last exercise write test and a small program in java to meet the AC for the rewritten stories.
### 1. Navigate to the GitHub link in chat.
### 2. Using Gherkin notation (Given, When, and Then) to write tests for the user stories.
### 3. Using Gherkin notation (Given, When, and Then) write a test that fails because of missing feature and then write code to pass the test.
### 4. Write the code and refactor making sure to keep the test you already wrote passing.
