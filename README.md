# Are these good user stories to use for automated tests?

## 1. **Title**: Integer greater than 1 returns 1 as a string
### **Description**: As a student I want to enter an integer greater than 1 and have it return the integer as a string so that I can win the game.
### **AC 1**: When 1 is given to the program then “1” is returned
### **AC 2**:  When 2 is given to the program then “2” is returned

## 2. **Title**: Integer evenly divisible by 3 returns "Fizz"
### **Description**: As a student I want to enter an integer that is evenly divisible by 3 so that it returns “Fizz”.
### **AC 1**: When 3 is given to the program then “Fizz” is returned

## 3. **Description**: As a student I want to enter an integer that is evenly divisible by 5 so that it returns “Buzz”.

## 4. ****Title****: As a student I want to enter an integer that is evenly divisible by 15 so that it returns “FizzBuzz”.
### **AC 1**: When 30 is given to the program then “FizzBuzz” is returned

# Write some tests using Gherkin for FizzBuzz stories.
## Using the new stories from the last exercise write test and a small program in java to meet the AC for the rewritten stories.
### 1. Navigate to the GitHub link in chat.
### 2. Using Gherkin notation (Given, When, and Then) to write tests for the user stories.
### 3. Using Gherkin notation (Given, When, and Then) write a test that fails because of missing feature and then write code to pass the test.
### 4. Write the code and refactor making sure to keep the test you already wrote passing.
